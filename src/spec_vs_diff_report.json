  "summary": "REQ-8/9/10/11 appear implemented: a new Admin page is added, reachable via header navigation, uses React Query hooks to load bookings with loading/empty/error states, supports delete with query invalidation, and sorts bookings newest-first on the page. One notable unrequested addition is a backend migration module/file, which also appears to violate the stated constraint to keep Motoko logic in backend/main.mo only.",
